  title: "First Online Presence"
  preview: "For the first time, the migraine aura is published online as a scientifically grounded computer simulation – making the invisible aura visible, also to others."
  text: "As a theoretical physicist, Markus Dahlem develops the first scientifically based computer simulation of the migraine aura as part of his doctoral thesis – without being affected himself. The model is based solely on the brain’s neural architecture. The animated visuals are published on the website of the Institute for Biophysics at Otto von Guericke University."

  text: "After the simulation is also published in a scientific journal, a personal letter from Oliver Sacks acknowledges this theoretical work. Dr. Sacks – known for putting the patient’s individuality at the center of evidence-based medicine – encourages Markus Dahlem to continue writing about migraine in an accessible and patient-focused way, aligned with the idea of public understanding of science."

  title: "First Public Response"
  preview: "An article in DIE WELT makes the migraine aura simulation widely known and prompts numerous responses from patients."
  text: "Under the headline 'How ghost images arise in the brain', DIE WELT reports on the migraine aura simulation – and strikes a chord. Many readers with migraine respond. For the first time, they see their subjective symptoms objectively represented – visible, understandable, explainable. The simulation helps them communicate their experience – with doctors, family, and friends."

  title: "Patient Forum Goes Live"
  preview: "With a forum, guestbook, and doctor area, one of the first interactive platforms for migraine with aura is created."
  text: "Driven by public interest in the aura simulation, an interactive online platform goes live: featuring a forum, guestbook, and a protected section for doctors. In its first year, it attracts impressive traffic and initiates connections with the German Migraine League and U.S. patient organization MAGNUM. It’s an early sign of the need for structured exchange between science, healthcare, and patients."

  title: "Collaboration with Dr. Klaus Podoll"
  preview: "A joint idea leads to the creation of a digital platform for Migraine Art."
  text: "Dr. Dahlem contacts neurologist Dr. Klaus Podoll to discuss content on Alice in Wonderland Syndrome for the platform. Within a year, they exchange over 1,000 emails – the beginning of a long-term collaboration. Podoll contributes a vast collection of materials that he had developed with Derek Robinson, who passed away in 2001. Robinson, a marketing manager at Boehringer Ingelheim UK, had been searching for impactful visuals to promote a new migraine prophylactic as early as 1973 – a 'desperate search,' as he wrote. This gave rise to the concept of Migraine Art, which found a digital home and became one of the world’s most significant collections of lived aura experiences."

  title: "Foundation and Vision for Digital Medicine"
  preview: "Alongside the foundation, a startup idea emerges: translating migraine research into digital applications."
  text: "With a growing network, guestbook, and the Migraine Art section, the Migraine Aura Foundation is officially founded. At the same time, a complementary entrepreneurial idea is born at the Interaction Center for Entrepreneurship in Magdeburg: MoteMedi – Mobile Telemedical Diagnostics. The aim is to translate neurophysiological knowledge into digital health applications. From the beginning, the initiative follows a dual path – nonprofit education and science communication on the one hand, translational research and digital product development on the other."

  title: "DFG Grant"
  preview: "A digital, personalized introspection tool is funded by the DFG – using early smartphones and exploring digital biomarkers."
  text: "Dr. Dahlem receives funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) to enable patients to engage with the migraine aura simulation for interactive, personalized introspection – based on individual anatomical brain parameters. Using smartphones, which were still novel at the time – four years before the iPhone – the idea was to capture brain parameters in real-time during daily life. The aim was to explore these data as potential targets for future therapies, laying early conceptual groundwork for today’s understanding of digital biomarkers – and the vision of closed-loop medicine."

  text: "The website of the Migraine Aura Foundation is nominated for the International Media Award for Science and Art – a competition by SWR, ZKM, ARTE, and SF DRS honoring outstanding projects at the intersection of science and art. The submitted representation of the migraine aura ranks among the top entries and is broadcast on public television across Europe in 2005."

  preview: "Thanks to the online collection, a publisher is found."
  text: "The materials on the visual representation of migraine auras compiled by Derek Robinson and Dr. Klaus Podoll are made publicly accessible via the foundation’s website. Based on this, a publisher is found, and the collection is published as a book documenting the diversity of subjective aura experiences."

  preview: "From a website section to a science blog with over 400 posts."
  text: "The science blog 'Graue Substanz' launches on SciLogs, a platform by Spektrum der Wissenschaft. Over the following years, it features more than 400 accessible posts offering new perspectives on migraine and its physiological basis. After the founding of Newsenselab, blogging largely ceases. The 'PepsiGate' scandal – involving sponsored content by PepsiCo on a science platform – heightens sensitivity to potential conflicts of interest in science communication."

  preview: "Public broadcasters take a holistic view of migraine – including a model-based approach from the foundation’s work."
  text: "In January 2010, the TV programs 'nano' (3sat) and 'drehscheibe Deutschland' (ZDF) dedicate a special feature to migraine. Markus Dahlem’s physics-based explanation of the migraine aura is presented as well – illustrating how scientific models can help communicate complex disease mechanisms in a patient-centered way."

  title: "YouTube Ban of Aura Simulation"
  preview: "The migraine aura simulation allegedly triggers migraine – or is it actually therapeutic?"
  text: "The video, scientifically grounded and accompanied by a warning, was viewed over 40,000 times before being abruptly taken down — reportedly because it might trigger migraine. A YouTube channel is, of course, not a certified medical product. But if a digital intervention is considered capable of provoking symptoms, its therapeutic potential deserves just as much scrutiny. The takedown thus became a symbolic turning point — the conceptual starting point for what would later evolve into digital aura resonance therapy."

  title: "Aura Resonance Therapy on the Radio"
  preview: "A segment on Deutschlandfunk introduces a novel, physics-based treatment concept to a broader public."
  text: "Deutschlandfunk features Dr. Dahlem’s research into migraine as a physical phenomenon. Central to the piece is the idea of interrupting the traveling wave of the aura in the brain using LED glasses. The media coverage shows that the concept resonates even beyond scientific circles – a signal that the time is ripe. A year later, this vision becomes the scientific foundation for the founding of Newsenselab."

  title: "GDPR-Induced Pause"
  preview: "The website goes offline – and the pause leads to a new direction."
  text: "Legal uncertainties about whether the thousands of patient reports, all documented with consent, meet the new GDPR requirements lead to the precautionary shutdown of the website in 2016. Although solutions were discussed, limited resources prevented implementation – especially since efforts were already shifting toward a new development path: the concept of neuromodulatory aura resonance as a therapy attracted investor interest. With new partners, it evolved into a digital therapeutic. Ultimately, a CBT-based method was implemented as a faster solution."
