  title: "Understanding the Migraine Brain"
  text: "As a theoretical physicist, Markus Dahlem develops the first computer simulation of migraine aura as part of his doctoral research – without being affected himself. Based solely on the brain’s neuronal architecture, he publishes animated simulations on the website of the Department of Biophysics at Otto von Guericke University."

  title: "Letter from Oliver Sacks"
  text: "Following the publication of the simulation in a scientific journal, Oliver Sacks sends a personal letter praising this theoretical work. Sacks – who always placed the patient’s lived experience at the heart of evidence-based medicine – encourages Dahlem to keep communicating migraine science in an accessible, patient-centered way."

  title: "Media Attention"
  text: "The German newspaper DIE WELT reports: 'How ghost images emerge in the brain.' Numerous readers respond. People living with migraine express how meaningful it is to see a computer simulation that gives objective shape to their otherwise subjective symptoms. This digital representation helps improve self-understanding as well as communication with healthcare providers, family, and friends."

  title: "Collaboration with Klaus Podoll Begins"
  text: "Markus Dahlem contacts neurologist Klaus Podoll to contribute content on Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Within one year, they exchange over 1,000 emails – the start of an intensive collaboration. Podoll brings a rich archive of material compiled with Derek Robinson, a marketing manager at Boehringer Ingelheim UK. In 1973, Robinson began a 'desperate search' for striking images to promote a new migraine prophylactic. From this effort, the concept of 'Migraine Art' was born – now the foundation of a unique collection of lived aura experiences."

  title: "Foundation and First Venture Idea"
  text: "The Migraine Aura Foundation is established, with a growing network, guestbook, and a dedicated Migraine Art section. Simultaneously, at the Entrepreneurship Interaction Center in Magdeburg, a parallel commercial concept is developed: MoteMedi (Mobile Telemedical Diagnostics) – an early venture focused on translating scientific insights into digital health solutions. From the beginning, the vision is twofold: nonprofit awareness and scientific communication on the one hand, translational research and product development on the other."

  title: "DFG Grant: A New Perspective on Patients"
  text: "Markus Dahlem receives a research grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The aim: to enable interactive introspection through aura simulations, tailored to individual brain anatomy – a conceptual precursor to digital biomarkers."

  title: "Award-Winning Education"
  text: "The foundation’s website is nominated for the International Media Award for Science and Art – a competition by SWR, ZKM, ARTE, and SF DRS recognizing outstanding projects at the intersection of science and the arts. The submission, featuring the aura simulation, is selected among the top entries and broadcast across public European channels."

  title: "Migraine Art: Now a Book"
  text: "The long-standing Migraine Art collection, curated by Derek Robinson and Klaus Podoll and hosted on the foundation’s website, is published as a visually and emotionally compelling book on lived aura experiences."

  title: "Pathophysiology Section Becomes a Blog"
  text: "The science blog 'Graue Substanz' is launched on SciLogs, hosted by Spektrum der Wissenschaft. Over 400 posts follow, offering accessible insights into migraine and brain physiology. The blog is largely paused with the founding of Newsenselab. Following the 'PepsiGate' controversy around sponsored content on scientific platforms, concern about conflicts of interest grows in science communication."

  title: "Migraine on Public TV"
  text: "In January 2010, German TV programs nano (3sat) and drehscheibe Deutschland (ZDF) feature a migraine spotlight. Markus Dahlem’s neurophysical approach to aura is included, showing how scientific models can enrich patient-centered narratives."

- date: "2011"
  title: "Literary Recognition"
  text: "In her book *The Shaking Woman*, author Siri Hustvedt describes how the foundation’s aura reports inspired new perspectives – including historical accounts like Carl Linnaeus seeing his own double. The book is surprisingly first published in German."

  title: "YouTube Blocks Aura Simulation"
  text: "YouTube removes the migraine aura simulation video – likely due to concerns that it might trigger migraines. Yet the video was based on peer-reviewed research, included a warning, and had over 40,000 views. Research even suggests that targeted visual stimuli may reduce sensitivity. While not a medical device, the video indirectly contributed to the concept behind M-sense – later approved by BfArM as a digital therapeutic with diagnostic capabilities."

  title: "Flashes of Light Against Migraine?"
  text: "A German public radio feature presents Dahlem’s research on aura as a neurophysical wave. The idea: an LED headset could interrupt the cortical wave with light stimuli. Though promising, the approach proves too risky, and the focus shifts to safer technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Still, the core idea remains – to stop migraine at its source using precise, physics-based modulation. This line of thinking leads to the founding of Newsenselab."

  title: "GDPR Pause and New Direction"
  text: "The website is taken offline due to legal uncertainty around whether thousands of documented patient reports comply with the EU's new GDPR standards. At the same time, earlier concepts developed under MoteMedi are revived – now with additional partners. The result: M-sense, the first and so far only migraine DiGA (digital health application) officially approved by BfArM for both therapeutic and diagnostic use. Though independent of the foundation, the project builds on its early pioneering ideas."
