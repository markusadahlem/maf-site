{"/about/":{"data":{"":" ","our-history#Our History":" 1998 – First Online Presence For the first time, the migraine aura is published online as a scientifically grounded computer simulation – making the invisible aura visible, also to others. [read more] → [read less] ↑ As a theoretical physicist, Markus Dahlem develops the first scientifically based computer simulation of the migraine aura as part of his doctoral thesis – without being affected himself. The model is based solely on the brain’s neural architecture. The animated visuals are published on the website of the Institute for Biophysics at Otto von Guericke University.\n03/2000 – Encouragement from a Bestselling Author and Neurologist A letter from neurologist and bestselling author Dr. Oliver Sacks becomes the spark for patient-centered science communication. [read more] → [read less] ↑ After the simulation is also published in a scientific journal, a personal letter from Oliver Sacks acknowledges this theoretical work. Dr. Sacks – known for putting the patient’s individuality at the center of evidence-based medicine – encourages Markus Dahlem to continue writing about migraine in an accessible and patient-focused way, aligned with the idea of public understanding of science.\n08/2000 – First Public Response An article in DIE WELT makes the migraine aura simulation widely known and prompts numerous responses from patients. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Under the headline 'How ghost images arise in the brain', DIE WELT reports on the migraine aura simulation – and strikes a chord. Many readers with migraine respond. For the first time, they see their subjective symptoms objectively represented – visible, understandable, explainable. The simulation helps them communicate their experience – with doctors, family, and friends.\n11/2000 – Patient Forum Goes Live With a forum, guestbook, and doctor area, one of the first interactive platforms for migraine with aura is created. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Driven by public interest in the aura simulation, an interactive online platform goes live: featuring a forum, guestbook, and a protected section for doctors. In its first year, it attracts impressive traffic and initiates connections with the German Migraine League and U.S. patient organization MAGNUM. It’s an early sign of the need for structured exchange between science, healthcare, and patients.\n2003 – Collaboration with Dr. Klaus Podoll A joint idea leads to the creation of a digital platform for Migraine Art. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Dr. Dahlem contacts neurologist Dr. Klaus Podoll to discuss content on Alice in Wonderland Syndrome for the platform. Within a year, they exchange over 1,000 emails – the beginning of a long-term collaboration. Podoll contributes a vast collection of materials that he had developed with Derek Robinson, who passed away in 2001. Robinson, a marketing manager at Boehringer Ingelheim UK, had been searching for impactful visuals to promote a new migraine prophylactic as early as 1973 – a 'desperate search,' as he wrote. This gave rise to the concept of Migraine Art, which found a digital home and became one of the world’s most significant collections of lived aura experiences.\n2004 – Foundation and Vision for Digital Medicine Alongside the foundation, a startup idea emerges: translating migraine research into digital applications. [read more] → [read less] ↑ With a growing network, guestbook, and the Migraine Art section, the Migraine Aura Foundation is officially founded. At the same time, a complementary entrepreneurial idea is born at the Interaction Center for Entrepreneurship in Magdeburg: MoteMedi – Mobile Telemedical Diagnostics. The aim is to translate neurophysiological knowledge into digital health applications. From the beginning, the initiative follows a dual path – nonprofit education and science communication on the one hand, translational research and digital product development on the other.\n2004 – DFG Grant A digital, personalized introspection tool is funded by the DFG – using early smartphones and exploring digital biomarkers. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Dr. Dahlem receives funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) to enable patients to engage with the migraine aura simulation for interactive, personalized introspection – based on individual anatomical brain parameters. Using smartphones, which were still novel at the time – four years before the iPhone – the idea was to capture brain parameters in real-time during daily life. The aim was to explore these data as potential targets for future therapies, laying early conceptual groundwork for today’s understanding of digital biomarkers – and the vision of closed-loop medicine.\n2005 – Media Award International nomination for the depiction of the migraine aura at the interface of science and art. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The website of the Migraine Aura Foundation is nominated for the International Media Award for Science and Art – a competition by SWR, ZKM, ARTE, and SF DRS honoring outstanding projects at the intersection of science and art. The submitted representation of the migraine aura ranks among the top entries and is broadcast on public television across Europe in 2005.\n2006 – Bilingual Relaunch A new design, improved structure – and for the first time, content in both German and English. [read more] → [read less] ↑ A complete website redesign introduces a modern content management system and bilingual structure. This relaunch is made possible by the media award prize money and private investments.\n2009 – Migraine Art Becomes a Book Thanks to the online collection, a publisher is found. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The materials on the visual representation of migraine auras compiled by Derek Robinson and Dr. Klaus Podoll are made publicly accessible via the foundation’s website. Based on this, a publisher is found, and the collection is published as a book documenting the diversity of subjective aura experiences.\n2009 – Blog on Migraine Physiology From a website section to a science blog with over 400 posts. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The science blog 'Graue Substanz' launches on SciLogs, a platform by Spektrum der Wissenschaft. Over the following years, it features more than 400 accessible posts offering new perspectives on migraine and its physiological basis. After the founding of Newsenselab, blogging largely ceases. The 'PepsiGate' scandal – involving sponsored content by PepsiCo on a science platform – heightens sensitivity to potential conflicts of interest in science communication.\n2010 – Migraine in a TV Special Public broadcasters take a holistic view of migraine – including a model-based approach from the foundation’s work. [read more] → [read less] ↑ In January 2010, the TV programs 'nano' (3sat) and 'drehscheibe Deutschland' (ZDF) dedicate a special feature to migraine. Markus Dahlem’s physics-based explanation of the migraine aura is presented as well – illustrating how scientific models can help communicate complex disease mechanisms in a patient-centered way.\n2011 – Literary Recognition The foundation is featured in Siri Hustvedt’s bestseller – as a source of new perspectives on neurological experiences. [read more] → [read less] ↑ In her book 'The Shaking Woman', Siri Hustvedt describes how the aura experiences on the foundation’s website opened up new perspectives for her – including the story of Carl Linnaeus, who saw his doppelgänger. The book is surprisingly published first in German in 2011.\n2011 – YouTube Ban of Aura Simulation YouTube removes a visual simulation of the migraine aura – allegedly because it might trigger migraines. Researchers suspect the opposite: that targeted visual stimuli could help with desensitization. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The video, which was scientifically grounded and included a warning, was viewed over 40,000 times. Of course, a YouTube channel is not a medical product. But the ban marked a symbolic turning point: if a digital intervention can potentially have side effects, its therapeutic potential also comes into focus – as the starting point for the later idea of digital aura resonance therapy.\n2015 – Aura Resonance Therapy on the Radio A segment on Deutschlandfunk introduces a novel, physics-based treatment concept to a broader public. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Deutschlandfunk features Dr. Dahlem’s research into migraine as a physical phenomenon. Central to the piece is the idea of interrupting the traveling wave of the aura in the brain using LED glasses. The media coverage shows that the concept resonates even beyond scientific circles – a signal that the time is ripe. A year later, this vision becomes the scientific foundation for the founding of Newsenselab.\n2016 – GDPR-Induced Pause The website goes offline – and the pause leads to a new direction. [read more] → [read less] ↑ Legal uncertainties about whether the thousands of patient reports, all documented with consent, meet the new GDPR requirements lead to the precautionary shutdown of the website in 2016. Although solutions were discussed, limited resources prevented implementation – especially since efforts were already shifting toward a new development path: the concept of neuromodulatory aura resonance as a therapy attracted investor interest. With new partners, it evolved into a digital therapeutic. Ultimately, a CBT-based method was implemented as a faster solution.\n2019 – Loss of a Pioneer With the death of Dr. Klaus Podoll, the foundation loses a key companion. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The passing of Dr. Klaus Podoll again delays the planned website relaunch and leaves a significant void. As a long-time contributor, he played a crucial role in shaping the platform’s content, network, and scientific depth.\n2022 – Instagram Launch Also on social media: aura knowledge becomes accessible, visual, and bilingual. [read more] → [read less] ↑ The Migraine Aura Foundation launches its presence on Instagram – with content in both German and English. The goal is to present aura knowledge in an accessible, visual format to reach new audiences and present existing knowledge in a contemporary way.\n2025 – Website Relaunch With Aura-o-mat and the return of the blog: the platform relaunches – more modern, interactive, and integrated.
