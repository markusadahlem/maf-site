{"/about/":{"data":{"":"Migraine affects nearly one billion people worldwide – a complex neurological condition with highly individual manifestations, where every symptom matters. That’s why we place the lived experience of those affected at the center of our work. The lived experience not only informs our content, but forms the basis of an open dialogue – one that you can be part of by sharing feedback, personal accounts, or insights with our team.\nDrawing on thousands of documented experiences, current clinical evidence, and one of the first neurophysiological simulations of migraine aura, we connect subjective experience with objective modeling – and develop digital tools that improve communication, diagnosis, and treatment.\nThis close integration of research, care, and the patient perspective has made us a pioneer in translational digital health – with the goal of strengthening health literacy and measurably improving care.\nBecause we are driven by impact: we apply technology where it makes a real difference – helping people better understand their condition, communicate more effectively, and manage life with migraine.","milestones-of-the-migraine-aura-foundation#Milestones of the Migraine Aura Foundation":" 1998 – Understanding the Migraine Brain [read more] → [read less] ↑ As a theoretical physicist, Markus Dahlem develops the first computer simulation of migraine aura as part of his doctoral research – without being affected himself. Based solely on the brain’s neuronal architecture, he publishes animated simulations on the website of the Department of Biophysics at Otto von Guericke University.\n03/2000 – Letter from Oliver Sacks [read more] → [read less] ↑ Following the publication of the simulation in a scientific journal, Oliver Sacks sends a personal letter praising this theoretical work. Sacks – who always placed the patient’s lived experience at the heart of evidence-based medicine – encourages Dahlem to keep communicating migraine science in an accessible, patient-centered way.\n08/2000 – Media Attention [read more] → [read less] ↑ The German newspaper DIE WELT reports: 'How ghost images emerge in the brain.' Numerous readers respond. People living with migraine express how meaningful it is to see a computer simulation that gives objective shape to their otherwise subjective symptoms. This digital representation helps improve self-understanding as well as communication with healthcare providers, family, and friends.\n11/2000 – Patient Forum Goes Live [read more] → [read less] ↑ Motivated by the momentum of 2000, the first interactive online platform is launched – including a forum, guestbook, and a dedicated section for professionals and patients alike.\n2003 – Collaboration with Klaus Podoll Begins [read more] → [read less] ↑ Markus Dahlem contacts neurologist Klaus Podoll to contribute content on Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Within one year, they exchange over 1,000 emails – the start of an intensive collaboration. Podoll brings a rich archive of material compiled with Derek Robinson, a marketing manager at Boehringer Ingelheim UK. In 1973, Robinson began a 'desperate search' for striking images to promote a new migraine prophylactic. From this effort, the concept of 'Migraine Art' was born – now the foundation of a unique collection of lived aura experiences.\n2004 – Foundation and First Venture Idea [read more] → [read less] ↑ The Migraine Aura Foundation is established, with a growing network, guestbook, and a dedicated Migraine Art section. Simultaneously, at the Entrepreneurship Interaction Center in Magdeburg, a parallel commercial concept is developed: MoteMedi (Mobile Telemedical Diagnostics) – an early venture focused on translating scientific insights into digital health solutions. From the beginning, the vision is twofold: nonprofit awareness and scientific communication on the one hand, translational research and product development on the other.\n2004 – DFG Grant: A New Perspective on Patients [read more] → [read less] ↑ Markus Dahlem receives a research grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The aim: to enable interactive introspection through aura simulations, tailored to individual brain anatomy – a conceptual precursor to digital biomarkers.\n2005 – Award-Winning Education [read more] → [read less] ↑ The foundation’s website is nominated for the International Media Award for Science and Art – a competition by SWR, ZKM, ARTE, and SF DRS recognizing outstanding projects at the intersection of science and the arts. The submission, featuring the aura simulation, is selected among the top entries and broadcast across public European channels.\n2006 – Website Relaunch [read more] → [read less] ↑ A complete redesign with a content management system and bilingual structure – made possible by the previous year's prize money and private investment.\n2009 – Migraine Art: Now a Book [read more] → [read less] ↑ The long-standing Migraine Art collection, curated by Derek Robinson and Klaus Podoll and hosted on the foundation’s website, is published as a visually and emotionally compelling book on lived aura experiences.\n2009 – Pathophysiology Section Becomes a Blog [read more] → [read less] ↑ The science blog 'Graue Substanz' is launched on SciLogs, hosted by Spektrum der Wissenschaft. Over 400 posts follow, offering accessible insights into migraine and brain physiology. The blog is largely paused with the founding of Newsenselab. Following the 'PepsiGate' controversy around sponsored content on scientific platforms, concern about conflicts of interest grows in science communication.\n2010 – Migraine on Public TV [read more] → [read less] ↑ In January 2010, German TV programs nano (3sat) and drehscheibe Deutschland (ZDF) feature a migraine spotlight. Markus Dahlem’s neurophysical approach to aura is included, showing how scientific models can enrich patient-centered narratives.\n2011 – Literary Recognition [read more] → [read less] ↑ In her book *The Shaking Woman*, author Siri Hustvedt describes how the foundation’s aura reports inspired new perspectives – including historical accounts like Carl Linnaeus seeing his own double. The book is surprisingly first published in German.\n2011 – YouTube Blocks Aura Simulation [read more] → [read less] ↑ YouTube removes the migraine aura simulation video – likely due to concerns that it might trigger migraines. Yet the video was based on peer-reviewed research, included a warning, and had over 40,000 views. Research even suggests that targeted visual stimuli may reduce sensitivity. While not a medical device, the video indirectly contributed to the concept behind M-sense – later approved by BfArM as a digital therapeutic with diagnostic capabilities.\n2015 – Flashes of Light Against Migraine? [read more] → [read less] ↑ A German public radio feature presents Dahlem’s research on aura as a neurophysical wave. The idea: an LED headset could interrupt the cortical wave with light stimuli. Though promising, the approach proves too risky, and the focus shifts to safer technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Still, the core idea remains – to stop migraine at its source using precise, physics-based modulation. This line of thinking leads to the founding of Newsenselab.\n2016 – GDPR Pause and New Direction [read more] → [read less] ↑ The website is taken offline due to legal uncertainty around whether thousands of documented patient reports comply with the EU's new GDPR standards. At the same time, earlier concepts developed under MoteMedi are revived – now with additional partners. The result: M-sense, the first and so far only migraine DiGA (digital health application) officially approved by BfArM for both therapeutic and diagnostic use. Though independent of the foundation, the project builds on its early pioneering ideas.\n2019 – Loss of a Pioneer [read more] → [read less] ↑ The passing of Dr. Klaus Podoll delays the planned website relaunch and leaves a profound void.\n2022 – Instagram Launch [read more] → [read less] ↑ New presence on Instagram – in both German and English.\n2025 – Website Relaunch [read more] → [read less] ↑ Relaunch of the website featuring the symptom checker 'Aura-o-mat' and reintegration of the science blog.","our-mission#Our Mission":"Making migraine visible – and clinically meaningful.","our-values#Our Values":" Patient-centeredness – Every individual experience matters Scientific integrity – Research drives our work Translational impact – Bringing research into real-world care Digital competence – Using technology to create meaningful patient benefit "},"title":"About us"},"/art/":{"data":{"":"In the 1970s, the concept of “migraine art” was developed.
