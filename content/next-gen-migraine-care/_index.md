**We invite digital health and neuroscience partners to join us in developing next-gen migraine care — focused not on pain relief alone, but on the neurological complexity that precedes and shapes the attack.**


Migraine care remained largely unchanged after triptans were introduced in the 1990s — but with the emergence of CGRP-targeting drugs, ditans, and gepants, a new era of therapeutic innovation has begun.

**But we believe innovation doesn’t stop at molecules**

We develop digital clincal measures and digital therapeutics as a new class of clinical tools — not as stand-alone apps, but as precision instruments and certified medical devices integrated into the care pathway.
When used in this way, they can complement, modulate, or even synergistically enhance pharmacological treatments — whether through support programs for timely intervention, desensitization strategies in the interictal phase, or hybrid approaches that merge the best of acute and preventive care.

**Our prototypes target:**

- therapy support programs for prophylaxis,

- actionable guidance during early or mild phases of acute treatment,

- desensitization strategies between attacks,

- and predictive, preemptive approaches that combine the best of prophylaxis and acute care.

Unlike conventional prophylaxis, preemptive strategies do not rely on the daily intake of medication. Instead, they aim for targeted intervention — precisely on the days before an attack is likely to occur.
