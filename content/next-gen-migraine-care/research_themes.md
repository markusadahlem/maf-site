A Mian, S Donoghue, Prieto, MA Dahlem, M Vives-Mestres, G Boucher, *The role of digital platforms and smartphone apps*, In: Migraine Pain Management, SB Shrewsbury (ed), Elsevier (2025)
> Here we show that modern digital platforms and smartphone apps can empower people with migraine to better manage their condition and monitor their symptoms.

{{< hextra/hero-subtitle style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0">}}**(II) On the physiological mechanism behind aura**
    {{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
</div>


MA Dahlem, *Mathematical modeling of human cortical spreading depression*, In: Neurobiological Basis of Migraine, T Dalkara and MA Moskowitz (eds), 285–305 (2017)
> Here we explain how cortical spreading depression — a wave of altered brain activity — is at the core of migraine aura, helping make sense of visual and sensory symptoms.

<div>
{{< hextra/hero-subtitle style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0">}}**(III) On digital biomarkers**
    {{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
</div>


MA Dahlem, J Kurths, MD Ferrari, K Aihara, M Scheffer, A May, *Understanding migraine using dynamic network biomarkers*, *Cephalalgia* 35, 627–630 (2015)
> Here we discuss how migraine can be understood as a dynamic brain network disorder, shifting how we view attacks not as isolated events but as part of a fluctuating system.

<div>
{{< hextra/hero-subtitle style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0">}}**(IV) On migraine art and personal experience**
    {{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
</div>


K Podoll, D Robinson, Oliver Sacks (Foreword)
*Migraine art: the migraine experience from within*,  North Atlantic Books; Illustrated edition (2009)
> Here we illustrate how the personal experience of migraine — especially aura — has inspired artistic expression, offering a window into the emotional and sensory world of those affected.

<div>
{{< hextra/hero-subtitle style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0">}}**(V) On rare aura symptoms like Alice in Wonderland syndrome**
    {{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
</div>


K Podoll, H Ebel, D Robinson, U Nicola, *Obligatory and facultative symptoms of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome*, *Minerva Medica* (2002)
> Here we explore rare aura symptoms such as distortions in size, time, and body perception, known as Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and their connection to migraine.
