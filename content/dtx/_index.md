## From Aura to Action

For over two decades, the _Migraine Aura Foundation_ has explored how neurological patterns reveal themselves — and how they might be influenced. Our work in modeling, diagnostics, and patient reporting laid the foundation for a new frontier: digital therapeutics grounded in brain science.


## From Research to Real-World Use

Long before digital therapeutics became a category, one of the _Migraine Aura Foundation_ founders explored how migraine research could inform digital care. Years later, this translational vision helped shape M-sense — the first DiGA-listed migraine app with ICHD-3-based diagnostics. The screenshots below showcase features that echo _Migraine Aura Foundation_’s commitment to translating insights directly into healthcare — through modeling, symptom tracking, and digital interaction design.

## Innovation in Migraine Care

After decades of therapeutic stagnation, migraine care is undergoing a transformation — from the launch of triptans in the 1990s to today’s CGRP-targeting drugs, ditans, and gepants. But innovation doesn’t stop at molecules. Digital therapeutics represent a new class of interventions — not as stand-alone apps, but as precision tools that can complement or even modulate pharmacological treatment. At _Migraine Aura Foundation_, we see this as a drug–device opportunity: using neurological models and patient-centered tools to design brain-based interventions that work alongside or beyond medication.
We’re exploring opportunities to bring this science into clinical practice — in collaboration with researchers, developers, and innovators in digital and pharmaceutical care.
