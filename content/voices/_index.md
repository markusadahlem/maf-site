Migraine aura is often an invisible burden — difficult to explain, hard to share. Here, we let the real voices of those affected speak for themselves, sharing their experiences and feedback about our website and its resources.

> "Thank you very much for this website. I have been suffering from migraine with aura for over 20 years. Time and again, I have tried to find fellow sufferers or a support group; **unfortunately, without success so far**."

> <span style="color: grey;">— <strong>B. E., email to Markus Dahlem, September 6, 2001</strong></span>

---

> “My experiences closely match the reports already published. Thank you — **it makes you feel less alone**, as I don't know anyone else who suffers from similar symptoms."
>

---

> “For just over a year now, I have been suffering from migraine aura without any subsequent headache, but with visual disturbances, word-finding difficulties, and impaired hearing. I underwent thorough examinations, including a CT scan, and the diagnosis was migraine without headache.
>
> I am very happy to have found your website, because **it is comforting to see that the symptoms I experience are also described by other affected individuals.**
>
> To be honest, I was initially somewhat skeptical of the diagnosis — after all: **migraine without headache, just with aura??!!**”
