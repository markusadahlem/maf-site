Migraine aura is often an invisible burden — difficult to explain, hard to share. Here, we let the real voices of those affected speak for themselves, sharing their experiences and feedback about our website and its resources.

> "Thank you very much for this website. I have been suffering from migraine with aura for over 20 years. Time and again, I have tried to find fellow sufferers or a support group; **unfortunately, without success so far**."

> “My experiences closely match the reports already published. Thank you — **it makes you feel less alone**, as I don't know anyone else who suffers from similar symptoms."

> “For just over a year now, I have been suffering from migraine aura without any subsequent headache, but with visual disturbances, word-finding difficulties, and impaired hearing. I underwent thorough examinations, including a CT scan, and the diagnosis was migraine without headache.
>
> I am very happy to have found your website, because **it is comforting to see that the symptoms I experience are also described by other affected individuals.**
>
> To be honest, I was initially somewhat skeptical of the diagnosis — after all: **migraine without headache, just with aura??!!**”

> “Finally, after more than 15 years, **I can come out: I am an aura freak**. I didn’t know about aura art until now either. It's wonderful that something like this exists — now I can really show everyone what it's like.”

> "First of all, huge compliments for the informative website. Like the other letters you’ve received, I too have never met anyone who suffers from the same symptoms — and that inevitably leads you to ponder and doubt.
>
> The symptoms described here match mine almost exactly.
>
> Perhaps you could also add that, for me, the headaches and nausea don’t really matter — **it’s the aura that causes fear, because you have absolutely no control over it**.
>
> Incidentally, I experienced my first migraine with aura at around the age of 12."

> “I just wanted to say a big thank you for the website, which I discovered only today.
>
> The stories and examples you have included in the website, people's auras in their own words, **has almost reduced me to tears**.
>
> **I feel incredibly relieved.** It explains so much to me. I see myself in their words.”

> “Please know how much I appreciate your kind attention to the issue of migraine aura.
>
> **I never thought I'd live to see the day** that describing visual and other sensory disturbances could be discussed openly and without shame.
>
> 'I know this sounds crazy but … '
>
> **is such a heavy load to carry.**
