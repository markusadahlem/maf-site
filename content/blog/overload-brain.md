But could they also _treat_ what they provoke? In this three-part series, I explore how visual hallucinations emerge in migraine, why some brains are hypersensitive to light, and whether precisely tuned stimuli might one day offer relief.

Visual hallucinations in migraine often take the form of geometric zigzag patterns. These can be explained by the aberrant activation of specific neurons—namely, edge and motion detectors. In turn, flickering light flashes with particular spatial and temporal properties can overstimulate these same neurons, potentially triggering a migraine in the first place.

This raises two pressing questions:
Which visual stimuli should people with migraine avoid?
And more provocatively: Could certain stimuli, if applied with precision, have a therapeutic effect—perhaps even preventing sensory overload?

To explore these questions—visual triggers, hallucinations, and the idea of using visual stimulation as a therapeutic tool—I’ll use a rather unexpected example: the hip-hop track »Migraine« by ArtOfficialMusic. It serves as a playful anchor for a series of three tightly connected challenges:

- What neural networks make migraineurs hypersensitive to specific visual stimuli?
- How do simple visual hallucinations—like zigzag patterns—emerge during a migraine attack?
- And most importantly: Could light itself, under the right conditions, become a therapeutic tool?

One point can be stated upfront: the »Migraine« music video is not therapeutic.

In one post of this series, I take up the first question: Why are people with migraine so sensitive to certain visual patterns? That discussion leads into the architecture of the visual cortex—specifically, the receptive fields of neurons and their elegant arrangement into so-called pinwheel maps. Like the better-known somatotopic map (the "homunculus") in the somatosensory system, pinwheel maps are one of the brain’s many topographic blueprints.

This post marks a shift in sensory modality—from touch to vision—which might make the connection to the earlier discussion less obvious at first glance. But conceptually, the link remains strong. That’s why I’m offering this brief roadmap.

A second post in the series explores the _Hip-Hop Neuroscience Fusion_. It shows how visual triggers and hallucinations may arise from the same cortical architecture, and uses a music video as a provocative entry point to bridge perception and pathophysiology.

The final post—_Visual Triggers, Hallucinations, and Therapy_—moves from explanation to exploration. It outlines a forward-looking view of potential acute treatments based on visual stimulation and introduces foundational ideas from theoretical physics. This brings us back to the blog’s central theme, as described in the _Gray Matters_ header: **bridging physics, neurology, and medical technology**.

Since the posts are being revised and republished in stages, this entry serves both as an introduction and a connective piece. Once all are available, links will be added here for easy navigation.
