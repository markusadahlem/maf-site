The articles presented here are revised editions of selected posts originally published on the science blogs »_Gray Matters_« and »_Graue Substanz_« (translated from German). These posts are being updated to reflect current context, improve clarity, and align with the Migraine Aura Foundation's mission: making migraine visible – and clinically meaningful.

Revisions are being made step by step. Older content is revisited, recontextualized, and where helpful, reinterpreted through today’s lens—while preserving the spirit of the original publications.
