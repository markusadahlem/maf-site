High-contrast stripe and zigzag patterns can trigger migraines. Simply put, this is due to how neurons are connected in the cerebral cortex—or more precisely, the "functional architecture" of the visual cortex. It consists of specialized, periodically arranged subunits that can be activated resonantly by matching spatiotemporal patterns in the visual field. This is at least a plausible hypothesis that aligns well with existing data from psychophysical experiments and mathematical modeling.

Epilepsy can also be triggered by visual stimuli. Photosensitive epilepsy is even a fairly well-known form of the condition. In this post, I won't go into the differences between the types of visual stimuli that trigger migraine versus epilepsy. Just this much: stripes and zigzag patterns are most often cited as migraine triggers, while colored light flashes—especially rapid intensity changes in red—are associated with epilepsy. These patterns have been shown to evoke epileptogenic potentials in EEG recordings [1,2]. I explained in the previous post how such spatiotemporal patterns are related to migraine.

Spatiotemporal patterns?
By spatial patterns, I simply mean an image. Accordingly, a spatiotemporal pattern is a sequence of images—a short film clip. That’s often how technical terms work: they sound more complex than they are. But I shouldn’t just say: epilepsy or migraine can be triggered by a film. Because these spatiotemporal patterns are highly specific stimuli, like created through a perfect stencil.

Though, to be fair, the idea of a film isn’t entirely wrong. Christian Reinboth (from the blog Frischer Wind) recently pointed out to me that epileptic seizures have been reported during a particularly color-intense scene with strobe-like flashes at the climax—the birth scene—in the new Twilight movie “Breaking Dawn.”

Director Bill Condon promised to make the birth scene as graphic and intense as possible. He succeeded. I haven’t seen the scene myself, but I suspect the color red played a major role.

“I think within the confines of a PG-13 rating, I think we’ve got something that’s pretty powerful.”
(Bill Condon, Director)

The PG-13 rating (“Not recommended for a younger audience but not restricted”) is roughly equivalent to Germany’s FSK 12 (approved for ages 12+). Unfortunately, adults also suffer from epilepsy and migraine. (Speaking of migraine—if you read the comments in The Guardian or HuffPost on the topic, you’ll find references to migraine too. In fact, visual triggers are rarely exclusive to just one of these neurological conditions—and that doesn’t surprise me, given the similar pathophysiology.)

The most famous epilepsy-inducing film sequence comes from the 1997 episode Dennō Senshi Porygon (“Cyber Soldier Porygon”) from Pokémon, which has since been banned. More than 600 children were hospitalized after its first (and only) broadcast—many of whom had never had a seizure before.

The image from the Pokémon episode (left) strikingly resembles a 19th-century drawing of a visual migraine aura (right).

Are the known visual migraine and epilepsy triggers light stimuli that have been culturally refined through replication and Gestalt principles—an image-based meme, so to speak—optimized for the brain’s modular architecture, to maximum effect? It’s not a stretch to say that directors aim to capture the ultimate adrenaline kick. The lightning-fast patterns they use are strikingly stereotypical. In primitive form, they were already found in comics—but now they’re computer-animated and everywhere.

Even Toy Story 3 and the first 3D spectacle Avatar were suspected of triggering seizures. But 3D effects alone don’t seem as critical [3] as the flashing, flickering, and zigzagging patterns projected onto cinema screens—and onto our personal screens. Smartphones, laptops—realistically, we’re never more than 30 cm away from at least one screen.

So it’s no surprise that wherever we look, ever brighter and faster sequences of images chase our attention—and perhaps unknowingly (or maybe not?), they are converging on optimally stimulating patterns, becoming stealthy migraine and epilepsy triggers.

You could describe this evolution as sensory overload by Dawkinsian principle. Because this adaptation occurs precisely because certain visual elements are copied, varied, and selected according to a criterion: the flashier, the better. What’s flashier than being labeled as “epileptogenic”? You can’t get more extreme than that. Though maybe I’m going too far. In any case, I’m not accusing anyone of malice—nor do I want to diagnose a cultural decline.

Every era, every culture has had its visual epilepsy and migraine triggers. We have Pokémon, vampire films, and… hip-hop. More on that later.
