represent and communicate various symptoms of a common disorder which
has afflicted mankind since the beginning of history.

## Derek Robinson's Migraine Art Concept

Migraine Art denotes the idea that pictorial representational art
provides an adequate and sometimes the best suited medium to express and
communicate the peculiar experiences of a migraine sufferer.

## Elective affinities between migraine-inspired artists

The notion of elective affinities between migraine-inspired artists
relates to the idea that the passion and interest that one artist may
take in the work and life of another artist may be governed or regulated
by their sharing of the experience of migraine aura as artistic
inspiration.
