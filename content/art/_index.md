## The Migraine Art Concept

Although its roots may be traced back to 19th century neurology, it was not until the
inspiring example of an art teacher's pictorial representations of her
migraine attacks, that the Migraine Art concept
was developed by Derek Robinson in the 1970s to serve as the basis of
four  National Migraine Art Competitions and similar contests
held in the UK and the United States, the results of which were
presented to the public in a number of exhibitions and publications in both the lay and medical press.

## Migraine and Visual Arts

Migraine experiences have served as a major source of artistic
inspiration in both past and contemporary painters, sculptors,
film-makers and other visual artists. A virtual gallery of
migraine-inspired art includes pieces from famous women and men like
[Hildegard of
Bingen](/content/e24966/e22874/e23377/index_en.html),
[Giorgio de
Chirico](/content/e24966/e22874/e23278/index_en.html),
[Salvador
Dali](/content/e24966/e22874/e24092/index_en.html),
[Yayoi
Kusama](/content/e24966/e22874/e24840/index_en.html),
[Marina
Abramovic](/content/e24966/e22874/e23720/index_en.html),
[Sarah
Raphael](/content/e24966/e22874/e24122/index_en.html),
to name just a few, as well as the work from many less well known (but
by no means less interesting) artists - and maybe soon your's too?

## Migraine and Literature

This section does not only provide literary descriptions of migraine
experiences from past and contemporary poets, story writers or
novelists, but also offers examples of migraine-related narratives from
Usenet Newsgroups, electronic diaries ("blogs") and other sources
encountered in the Internet, including the self-observations of
scientists such as Marvin, Oliver
Sacks and others. Your contributions are welcome, too! Comments on these
selected texts address the issues of metaphors of migraine, migraine and
creativeness, and migraine aura and spiritual experience.

## Migraine and Music

Finally, it is known that some famous musicians have suffered from
migraines − from classical composer Gustav
Mahler,
over King of Rock'n'Roll Elvis
Presley,
and Jeff
Tweedy,
singer/songwriter from the alternative country band Wilco, to Alwa
Glebe the German "dark chanteuse", to mention just a few. Did the composers'
and performers' migraines influence their art?
