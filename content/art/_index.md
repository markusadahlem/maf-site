In the 1970s, the concept of "migraine art" was developed. It refers to the idea that visual art is an appropriate and sometimes the most suitable medium for expressing and communicating the unique experiences of migraine sufferers.

A painting created as an entry for a migraine art competition in 1985
depicts the “Programmed (Unwillingly) Migraine Computer,” which, according to the
artist, can generate five types of scintillating scotomas: rainbow, fortification, mobile
stellate, pericentral, and expanding angular. This variety reflects the specialized func-
tional mapping within the visual cortex.
