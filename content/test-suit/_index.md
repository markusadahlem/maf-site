Explore your personal migraine cycle using simple, research-based tasks.
From perception to insight — across every phase of the attack.



## The _Seeing Jesus in Toast_ Task

The migraine brain is special. 


Every brain spots faces in toast because an evolutionarily honed detection mechanism fires rapidly and erratically, before slower, more selective processes correct the false alarm. 

In the images below, it is actually not a flase alram, we digitally "_toasted_" faces so you can see 
 Jesus (left) or Aphrodite (right) and turned this into a task.  **More coming soon.**

## The _Waterfall_ Task

**Coming soon:**

## The Vertical Motion Task (Motion Up/Down)

**What it tests:** Your ability to detect movement direction — specifically whether dots are moving upward or downward.

**How it works:** A screen shows many dots. Some move together in one direction (up or down), others move randomly. You need to say whether the overall movement is up or down.

**Why it's important:** Migraine sufferers needed a higher proportion of dots to move in the same direction before they could tell which way the group was going. This suggests their motion perception is less precise between attacks.

# Oblique Motion Task (Motion Left/Right)

**What it tests:** Your ability to detect angled motion, like movement that's both up and to the left, or down and to the right.

**How it works:** Similar to Task 1, but this time the direction of motion is diagonal. You judge whether the motion was left-leaning or right-leaning.

**Why it's important:** This task checks whether people with migraines are worse at spotting motion that isn’t straight up/down, revealing specific weaknesses in the brain’s motion processing system.



## Cardinal Orientation Task (Vertical/Horizontal Lines)

**What it tests:** How well you can see the overall orientation of many short lines — whether they appear mostly vertical or horizontal.

**How it works:** You see a bunch of short lines on the screen. Some are aligned in one direction (vertical or horizontal), while others are randomly angled. You say which direction the group seems to be pointing in.

**Why it's important:** This measures your brain’s ability to "see the pattern" amid visual noise.

## Oblique Orientation Task (Slanted Lines)

**What it tests:** Like Task 3, but this time the main lines are angled (e.g., slanted left or right from vertical), not straight.

**How it works:** Again, you see lots of short lines. Some lean left, others lean right. You try to figure out the dominant slant.

**Why it's important:** Humans are usually worse at detecting slanted lines compared to vertical or horizontal — a phenomenon called the “oblique effect.” The study investigates whether this effect is stronger in people with migraines.
