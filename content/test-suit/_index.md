**A new way to understand the migraine brain**

Our aim is to highlight experiences before, during, and between migraine attacks that traditional checklists miss.

The Seeing-Jesus-in-Toast test is part of the MigraineBrainRadar™ and reveals how your brain makes sense of vague or noisy images — a phenomenon called pareidolia. It’s part of a growing set of perception tasks designed to explore how your brain processes the world — before, directly after, and inbetween migraine attacks.

<!-- ## A Toolkit Informed by Science, Experience, and Openness

Our tools combine scientific knowledge of how the brain works with the lived experience of people who have migraine. We believe that open, exploratory work — shared transparently and refined over time — is essential to uncovering new ways of understanding and managing migraine. The Jesus-in-Toast Task is just one example of this approach.

## Your Voice Enters Research

We believe that people living with migraine shouldn't just be the subject of research — they should help shape it. That’s why our approach is rooted in Patient and Public Involvement (PPI): research carried out *with*, not *for*, those who experience migraine.

Through this model, your experiences help define what questions are asked, how tools are developed, and what outcomes matter. It’s a form of citizen science in medicine — and you can be part of it.
