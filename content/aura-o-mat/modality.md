### Which aura symptoms have you experienced?

We’re first checking for one or more fully reversible aura symptoms, as defined by clinical guidelines.

Aura symptoms affect different sensory or functional modalities — such as vision, sensation, speech, or movement.

Please select all symptoms you’ve experienced during your aura.  
Choose “Other” if you’ve had additional modalities not listed here.  
Choose “None” if none of these apply.
