##  Beyond the Typical Visual Zigzags

**Migraine aura isn‚Äôt only visual** ‚Äî
for some it is, but many experience effects on speech, sensation, or thinking.

**Migraine aura isn‚Äôt always temporary** ‚Äî

**Migraine aura isn‚Äôt always followed by a headache** ‚Äî

We‚Äôre here to help you understand the broader spectrum of migraine aura ‚Äî
beyond what most people (and even many doctors) expect.
