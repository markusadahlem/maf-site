**Co-Create the Next Generation of Migraine Care**

We are seeking partners to develop app features that advance migraine treatment:
—from support programs for prophylaxis and timely action during mild phases for acute treatment,
to brain desensitization strategies in the interictal interval and preemptive approaches that combine the best of prophylaxis and acute care.
Let’s turn insight into intervention—together.

### From Aura to Action

For over two decades, the _Migraine Aura Foundation_ has explored how neurological patterns reveal themselves — and how they might be influenced. Our work in modeling, diagnostics, and patient reporting laid the foundation for a new frontier: digital therapeutics grounded in brain science.


### From Research to Real-World Use

Long before digital therapeutics became a category, one of the _Migraine Aura Foundation_ founders explored how migraine research could inform digital care. Years later, this translational vision helped shape M-sense — the first DiGA-listed migraine app with ICHD-3-based diagnostics. The screenshots below showcase features that echo _Migraine Aura Foundation_’s commitment to translating insights directly into healthcare — through modeling, symptom tracking, and digital interaction design.

### Innovation in Migraine Care

{{< figure src="/images/aura-resonance-therapy.png" alt="The migraine computer"  >}}


After decades of therapeutic stagnation, migraine care is undergoing a transformation — from the launch of triptans in the 1990s to today’s CGRP-targeting drugs, ditans, and gepants. But innovation doesn’t stop at molecules. Digital therapeutics represent a new class of interventions — not as stand-alone apps, but as precision tools that can complement or even modulate pharmacological treatment. At _Migraine Aura Foundation_, we see this as a drug–device opportunity: using neurological models and patient-centered tools to design brain-based interventions that work alongside or beyond medication.
We’re exploring opportunities to bring this science into clinical practice — in collaboration with researchers, developers, and innovators in digital and pharmaceutical care.
