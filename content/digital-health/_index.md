**Charting the course for tomorrow's migraine care.**

We believe that medication reaches its full potential when enhanced by smart software.
People living with migraine deserve digital support that helps them better understand their condition — and treat their attacks earlier and more precisely, especially in the critical pre-headache phase.

That’s what we’ve been working on for over 30 years.

This page shares where we started, what we’ve built, and where we see the future going.












### From Patient-centric Research to Real-World Use

Our migraine research dates back to the mid-1990s. Since 2004, we’ve been working to translate scientific insights into digital care solutions --- long before digital therapeutics (DTx) were recognized as a distinct treatment category.

### Bridging Research and Prescription

_M-sense_ was the first prescription DTx (aka DiGA; digital health application) for migraine, offering cognitive behavioral therapy as a low-threshold entry point — and as a way to collect data for the next generation of digital neuromodulatory interventions.



<!--While we are not offering a migraine app at the moment — and the M-sense DTx is currently unavailable — our work continues.
We are advancing digital, model-based strategies that aim to give patients real agency: to recognize patterns, predict attacks, and possibly redirect the course of an episode.-->

Unfortunately, the approval trial did not yield the desired results for permanent DiGA listing. And while the data collection showed great promise, the company lacked the funding to take the next step: targeted reprogramming of the migraine brain.

More Than Visualization: When Seeing Becomes Intervention

The Aura-o-mat™ and the [MigraineBrainRadar™](test-suit/migrainebrainradar/) both help detect visual and other sensory auras and early warning signs in the prodromal phase, respectively — opening a time window for preemptive pharmacological intervention.

But it doesn’t stop there: we are exploring how targeted visual stimulation can actively influence the brain during this sensitive phase — by modulating so-called "_hot spots_" and "_labyrinths_", i.e.,  vulnerable neural pathways.

Our goal is to translate insights from brain modeling into digital therapeutic approaches that not only predict the course of a migraine attack, but actively redirect it.



### When Vision Becomes Therapy

This short simulation visualizes the migraine aura as it emerges from brain circuitry — offering a glimpse of how precisely tuned stimuli might one day reprogram these circuits through neuroplasticity.

**Experience a Migraine Aura Simulation**: For best results, change to full screen (f), fix your gaze on the fly, and <span style="color:red;">wait for at least ~20 seconds for the aura to emerge</span>. Do **not** move your gaze away from the fly even so the aura expands into your peripheral vision.
