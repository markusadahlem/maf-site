**Charting the course for tomorrow's migraine care.**

At the Migraine Aura Foundation, we believe that medication can do more when paired with digital insight. People living with migraine deserve tools that help them understand their brain state — and help optimize the timing and precision of pharmacological treatment.

This page shares where we started, what we’ve built, and where we see the future going.












### From Patient-centric Research to Real-World Use

Since 2004, we explored how migraine research can inform digital care---long before _digital therapeutics_ became a recognized treatment category. Learn more about our history in our [_About Us_](/about) section.

### Bridging Research and Prescription

M-sense was the first prescription DTx for migraine, offering CBT as a low-threshold entry point to collect data for brain-based interventions. While the app succeeded in that first step, the company lacked the funding to advance toward reprogramming the migraine brain.



<!--While we are not offering a migraine app at the moment — and the M-sense DTx is currently unavailable — our work continues.
We are advancing digital, model-based strategies that aim to give patients real agency: to recognize patterns, predict attacks, and possibly redirect the course of an episode.-->

Visual simulations aren’t just for understanding migraine — they may become part of how we treat it.
By engaging the brain early in an attack, targeted stimuli can intervene in so-called “hot spots” and modulate activity along susceptible neural trajectories.
Our goal is to turn insights from brain modeling into therapeutic strategies — shaping how the migraine unfolds, not just how it's endured.



### When Vision Becomes Therapy

This short simulation visualizes the migraine aura as it emerges from brain circuitry — offering a glimpse of how precisely tuned stimuli might one day reprogram these circuits through neuroplasticity.

**Watch the simulation:** Fix your gaze on the fly and wait for at least ~20 seconds for the aura to emerge. This experience is based on actual brain models used in our research.
