**To take back control means treating migraine smarter.**

We believe the _holy grail_ lies in preemptive therapy — not supressing the attack not even just stopping the attack, but reshaping how the brain responds to migraine altogether.

Achieving this means forecasting the event and this meand overcoming five core challenges — powered by what we name **Sense & Signal™**, our data fusion AI approach.

- **Sense** is about noticing what’s already there — the early, often-overlooked symptoms that suggest an attack may be coming.

- **Signal** is about actively probing the migraine brain — using digital tools to detect hidden instabilities before pain begins.

— **Atul Gawande**, In: The Heroism of Incremental Care

Our approach to migraine forecasting isn’t about replacing traditional care — it’s about strengthening it.
As Atul Gawande described in his landmark New Yorker article on incremental medicine, real progress often comes step by step. People with migraine need that same steady, long-term support — and so do their doctors. That’s the spirit behind our work.

Below, we introduce five key challenges on the path toward preemptive migraine therapy — not as fixed answers, but as a roadmap in progress.

## The 5 Challenges for Preemptive Therapy

### 1. Increase Sensitivity
How often is the sign present before a migraine attack?
Some warning signs are subtle, irregular, or dismissed as everyday fluctuations. To increase sensitivity, we combine symptom tracking with dynamic testing — probing the brain’s shifting state to detect early changes even before subjective awareness. It’s about catching the quiet signals before they vanish.

### 2. Increase Precision
How often does a migraine attack follow the sign?
Not every signal means trouble. That’s why we go beyond surface patterns. Like a diagnostic in chemical biology, our tools aim to identify specific physiological signatures — using perception and behavior as readouts of brain instability. Precision means fewer false hopes, more timely actions.

### 3. Reduce the False-Positive Rate
How often do we get a false alarm?
A signal you can’t trust is worse than none at all. By probing the migraine brain with structured tasks — rather than relying on vague gut feelings — we work to lower false alarms. Smart prompts and network-based models help us distinguish real warnings from background noise.

### 4. Dissolve the Early Warning Paradox
What if a good intervention hides its own success?
Here’s the paradox: if a warning helps prevent an attack, it may look like it was wrong. We’re developing methods to account for this — treating the warning as a causal probe, not just a forecast. Like in chemical screens, success sometimes hides its own trail — we make it visible again.

### 5. Hit the Timing Sweet Spot
When is it early enough — and not too late?
Timing is everything. Our focus is the narrow 72–24 hour window before headache begins — when the brain is shifting, but you may not yet feel anything. Through short digital tests and pattern recognition, we aim to detect this physiological “sweet spot” — and act before migraine takes hold.
