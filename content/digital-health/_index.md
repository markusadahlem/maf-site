### From Patient-centric Research to Real-World Use

Since 2004, the Migraine Aura Foundation has explored how migraine research can inform digital care---long before _digital therapeutics_ became a recognized treatment category.

### Bridging Research and Prescription

Our pioneering work laid the foundation for turning scientific insight into actionable tools — including the first prescription digital therapeutic (DTx) for migraine.

The screenshots below illustrate how our thinking helped shape key features of M-sense: dynamic symptom tracking, brain-state modeling, and intuitive interaction design. These are not just interface choices — they reflect a new therapeutic logic grounded in neurology, usability, and lived experience.

### Seeing Migraine Through the Brain’s Eye

What does a migraine aura feel like — from the inside?
This short simulation brings you close: it’s not a visual gimmick, but the result of brain network modeling grounded in neurophysics. 

**Watch the simulation:** Fix your gaze on the fly and wait ~15 seconds for the aura to emerge. This experience is based on actual brain models used in our research.

Visual simulations aren’t just for understanding migraine — they may become part of how we treat it.
By engaging the brain early in an attack, targeted stimuli can intervene in so-called “hot spots” and modulate activity along susceptible neural trajectories.
Our goal is to turn insights from brain modeling into therapeutic strategies — shaping how the migraine unfolds, not just how it's endured.

<!--After decades of therapeutic stagnation, migraine care is undergoing a transformation — from the launch of triptans in the 1990s to today’s CGRP-targeting drugs, ditans, and gepants. But innovation doesn’t stop at molecules. Digital therapeutics represent a new class of interventions — not as stand-alone apps, but as precision tools that can complement or even modulate pharmacological treatment. At _Migraine Aura Foundation_, we see this as a drug–device opportunity: using neurological models and patient-centered tools to design brain-based interventions that work alongside or beyond medication.
We’re exploring opportunities to bring this science into clinical practice — in collaboration with researchers, developers, and innovators in digital and pharmaceutical care.
