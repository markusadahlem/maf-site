### Increase Sensitivity

Can we tell when a migraine is starting — before it really begins?

That’s what sensitivity is about:
How often is there an early sign before an attack?

In our **Sense & Signal™** approach, a sign can be:
- a symptom, i.e.,
  - a premonitory symtoms, like yawning or food craving 
  - an aura, like flickering vision or speech issues,
- or a digital clinical measure, that shows early brain changes.

The Challenge: early symtoms are easy to miss. They may  feel vague, or get mistaken for normal ups and downs.
