### Understand the Early Warning Paradox

If a warning helps you stop a migraine, it may look like it was wrong — because no attack happened.

This is like the preparedness paradox: when action prevents disaster, people question whether the warning was ever needed.

In migraine care, this makes it hard to tell if early signs or tests truly helped. We’re developing ways to treat these signals as causal probes, not just forecasts — so we can learn what works, even when success hides the evidence.
