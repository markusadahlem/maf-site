### Understand Precision

Suppose you found a reliable sign — can you always trust it?

That’s what precision is about:  
How often does a migraine really follow the sign?  
High precision means you rarely get a false alarm.

And that’s valuable.
If you’ve found a sign that reliably predicts an attack — hold onto it.

But be aware: signs with high precision often have low sensitivity. They don’t show up often — so you may miss many attacks that don’t follow this pattern.

We’re working on algorithms to improve this balance. But we’re not there yet.

For now, precision is powerful — and limited.
It’s one piece of the puzzle.
