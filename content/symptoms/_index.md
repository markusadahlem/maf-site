## Transitory Symptoms

### Body Image Disturbances

### Anomic aphasia

"_I KNOW I have some form of aphasia, too, before the onset of the migraine. It's very irritating for people to have to try and complete my sentences for me. Example: 'Erica, could you make sure the milk gets put back into the....the....oh, it's a simple word, you know what I mean....(exasperated sounds)' 'Mom, do you mean 'refrigerator'?' 'YES!, that's the word I was searching for!' 'Daaaaad, mom's acting really weird again!'_"   
(Anne Buede, Newsgroups: alt.support.headaches.migraine, Subject: anyone "manic" before a migraine?, February 17, 1998)

"_I was just reminded by someone who loves me very much: P that it gets even stranger than I just described: Me: 'Honey, could you....um....you know, (here I begin to make lifting motions with my arms), could you do that thing....that movement where you ...do something....to the milk... so that it gets into the refrigerator?' Erica: 'Mom , do you want me to 'pick up' the milk?' Me: 'Yes'! Erica: 'Daaaaad! Are you sure it's safe to let Mom out of the house...?'_"

In contrast to a visual hallucination which is defined as a visual perception that is not associated with external visual stimuli, a visual illusion is a distortion or modification of a real visual image (Pelak and Liu, 2004). The following webpages will provide examples from the medical literature and from migraine sufferers' self-reports in the internet for various types of visual illusions that may occur as visual migraine aura symptoms.
