"_I KNOW I have some form of aphasia, too, before the onset of the migraine. It's very irritating for people to have to try and complete my sentences for me. Example: 'Erica, could you make sure the milk gets put back into the....the....oh, it's a simple word, you know what I mean....(exasperated sounds)' 'Mom, do you mean 'refrigerator'?' 'YES!, that's the word I was searching for!' 'Daaaaad, mom's acting really weird again!'_"

"_I was just reminded by someone who loves me very much: P that it gets even stranger than I just described: Me: 'Honey, could you....um....you know, (here I begin to make lifting motions with my arms), could you do that thing....that movement where you ...do something....to the milk... so that it gets into the refrigerator?' Erica: 'Mom , do you want me to 'pick up' the milk?' Me: 'Yes'! Erica: 'Daaaaad! Are you sure it's safe to let Mom out of the house...?'_"
