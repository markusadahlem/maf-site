# X-Migraine Aura Report

Provided by the Migraine Aura Foundation
Result: Your responses suggest you may be experiencing migraine aura.

## Summary

Based on your answers, your symptoms are consistent with migraine aura, a neurological
phenomenon that often precedes or accompanies migraine headaches.
This type of migraine is historically referred to as:
Classic migraine, ophthalmic migraine, hemiparaesthetic migraine, hemiplegic migraine, aphasic
migraine, migraine accompagnée, or complicated migraine.

## Diagnostic Threshold Reached
Your responses indicate that the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine with aura have likely been met.
This means that a sufficient number of typical features—such as gradual onset, full reversibility,
limited duration, and association with headache—were present to suggest a pattern consistent
with migraine aura.
These criteria help differentiate migraine aura from other possible neurological conditions.
