## Introduction 

Migraine aura can take many forms—some well known, others often overlooked.

The symptom check tool is designed to help you explore whether your symptoms align with the internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine aura (ICHD-3).

At the Migraine Aura Foundation, we’ve learned from over 7,000 patient accounts since 2000. While we adhere to current medical standards, we also recognize that science evolves—and we actively contribute to advancing how migraine aura is understood.

This tool is not a medical diagnosis and is intended for informational purposes only.

Neurological symptoms can have many different causes—some of them serious. This tool assumes that your symptoms are not better explained by another medical condition, such as epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a known eye disorder.


If your symptoms are **new, unusual, worsening**, or occur **alongside other health issues**, please **seek medical advice immediately**.
