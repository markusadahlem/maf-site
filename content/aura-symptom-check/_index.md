## Introduction 

Migraine aura can take many forms‚Äîsome well known, others often overlooked.

The symptom check tool is designed to help you explore whether your symptoms align with the internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine aura (ICHD-3).

At the Migraine Aura Foundation, we‚Äôve learned from over 7,000 patient accounts since 2000. While we adhere to current medical standards, we also recognize that science evolves‚Äîand we actively contribute to advancing how migraine aura is understood.
