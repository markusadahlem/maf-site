Based on your responses, you display at least three of the hallmark features described in the internationally recognized diagnostic guidelines (ICHD-3). Our extensive data—gathered from over 7,000 patient accounts since 2000—supports that these symptoms are common among those experiencing migraine aura.

While this result aligns with established criteria and our collective patient insights, please remember that this tool is for informational purposes only. It does not replace a formal medical evaluation. We encourage you to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.
