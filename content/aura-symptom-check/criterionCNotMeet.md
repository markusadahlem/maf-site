# ⚠️ You Do Not Meet The Second Criterion 

Fewer than three key characteristics apply.

Based on your answers, fewer than three of the key features associated with migraine aura are present. This suggests that your symptom profile does not fully align with Criterion C as defined by the ICHD-3 guidelines. However, not meeting this criterion does not rule out migraine aura—it simply reflects the diversity in symptom experiences.

If you continue to experience concerning symptoms or if your health situation changes, we strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional. Remember, our tool is designed to provide insights based on a broad patient base and is not a substitute for a medical diagnosis.

For further explanation and to learn more about how these criteria are applied, please review our detailed breakdown or speak with your doctor.
