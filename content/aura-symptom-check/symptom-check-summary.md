# ✅ You Meet The  Second Criterion 

At least three key characteristics of migraine aura are present.

Based on your responses, you display at least three of the hallmark features described in the internationally recognized diagnostic guidelines (ICHD-3). Our extensive data—gathered from over 7,000 patient accounts since 2000—supports that these symptoms are common among those experiencing migraine aura.

While this result aligns with established criteria and our collective patient insights, please remember that this tool is for informational purposes only. It does not replace a formal medical evaluation. We encourage you to discuss these findings with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

For more details on what each characteristic means and further guidance on managing migraine aura, please explore our additional resources or contact a professional.

# Migraine Aura Report

Provided by the Migraine Aura Foundation
Result: Your responses suggest you may be experiencing migraine aura.

## Summary

Based on your answers, your symptoms are consistent with migraine aura, a neurological
phenomenon that often precedes or accompanies migraine headaches.
This type of migraine is historically referred to as:
Classic migraine, ophthalmic migraine, hemiparaesthetic migraine, hemiplegic migraine, aphasic
migraine, migraine accompagnée, or complicated migraine.

## Diagnostic Threshold Reached
Your responses indicate that the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine with aura have likely been met.
This means that a sufficient number of typical features—such as gradual onset, full reversibility,
limited duration, and association with headache—were present to suggest a pattern consistent
with migraine aura.
These criteria help differentiate migraine aura from other possible neurological conditions.
