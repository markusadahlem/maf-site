## Migraine Aura Report – Evaluation Inconclusive

Provided by the Migraine Aura Foundation

**Result:** Your responses suggest you may have experienced an aura-like episode.

However, based on the information provided, we were unable to complete an evaluation using standard clinical criteria.

### Summary

Migraine aura typically involves one or more fully reversible neurological symptoms, affecting specific functional areas such as:

- Vision (e.g., shimmering lights, blind spots)
- Sensation (e.g., tingling, numbness)
- Speech or language
- Muscle control (e.g., weakness)
- Brainstem functions (e.g., vertigo, double vision)
- Retinal function (e.g., temporary vision loss in one eye)

These symptom types—known as aura modalities—are used to identify and assess migraine aura based on the guidelines from the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3).

### Why the Evaluation Could Not Continue

You selected only "Other" when asked about your aura symptoms. Because this tool relies on clearly defined aura modalities to determine whether further criteria can be evaluated, your answer could not be matched to a recognized category.

As a result, we were not able to assess whether your symptom fits the clinical pattern of migraine aura.

### Recommendation

Although your experience may still be related to migraine or another neurological condition, we recommend speaking with a healthcare professional, particularly if:

Your symptoms are new, unusual, or changing

You experience additional or more specific symptoms in future episodes

You have concerns about other possible causes

A qualified clinician can help interpret your individual case, assess whether further testing is needed, and advise on the best course of action.
