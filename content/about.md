The Migraine Aura Foundation was founded in 2004 to improve care for people living with migraine through patient-centered education and digital innovation.
Rooted in the first neurophysiological simulation of the aura (1998) and based on thousands of analyzed patient reports, it has grown into one of the world’s leading knowledge platforms on neurological migraine symptoms.
Acting at the intersection of science, patient experience, and healthcare delivery, we drive translationally oriented projects – digital, evidence-based, and uncompromisingly patient-centered.


## Our Mission
We highlight what is often overlooked: Every migraine sign counts.
Our mission is to strengthen health literacy and patient agency by making neurological symptoms like aura easier to understand, diagnostically actionable, and relevant to clinical care.
Through digital education, symptom checkers, patient insights, and a commitment to translational research, we contribute to more accurate diagnoses, better clinical communication, and person-centered care.
